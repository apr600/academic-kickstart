I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Learning Algorithms and Systems (LASA) lab at EPFL under Prof. Aude Billard. My work focuses on developing learning and control algorithms for efficient human-robot collaboration and learning. I obtained my Ph.D. in Robotics at Northwestern University in Prof.  Todd Murphey's lab. My Ph.D. work centered on information communication algorthms to enable intuitive human-robot collaboration and efficient robot learning using distribution-based motion representations and information-theoretic measures. I also led Northwestern's team for the DARPA OFFSET Urban Swarm Challenge, developing autonomous swarm algorithms for shared human-swarm collaboration and exploring their efficacy in aiding task performance under dynamic, time-sensitive constraints.
