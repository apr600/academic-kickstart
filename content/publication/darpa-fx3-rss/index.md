abstract: "This paper presents a formulation for swarm control
and high-level task planning that is dynamically responsive to
user commands and adaptable to environmental information.
We design an end-to-end pipeline from a tactile tablet interface
for user commands to onboard control of robotic agents based
on decentralized ergodic coverage. Our approach demonstrates
reliable and dynamic control of a swarm collective through the
use of ergodic specifications for planning and executing agent
trajectories as well as responding to user and external inputs.
We validate our approach in a virtual reality simulation
environment and in real-world experiments with a robotic swarm
where user-based control of the swarm and mission-based tasks
require a dynamic and flexible response to changing conditions
and objectives in real-time."
